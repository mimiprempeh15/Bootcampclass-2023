Installing Terraform on Ubuntu Linux involves a few steps to download the Terraform binary and make it executable from the command line. Here is a general guide on how to do it:

1. **Download the Terraform package**
   - First, you need to download the latest version of Terraform. HashiCorp (the creators of Terraform) provides a direct link to download Terraform from their website.
   - You can also use `wget` or `curl` to download Terraform directly from the command line. It's important to check the [official Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) for the latest version and update the download link accordingly.

2. **Unzip the package**
   - Once the download is complete, you will have a `.zip` file. You'll need to unzip this file to extract the Terraform binary. The `unzip` utility can do this, and you can install it with `sudo apt-get install unzip` if it's not already installed on your system.

3. **Move the Terraform binary to a directory included in your system's PATH**
   - It's common to move the Terraform binary to `/usr/local/bin` because this directory is included in the system's `PATH` by default. Moving it there allows you to run Terraform from any location in your terminal.

4. **Verify the installation**
   - After moving the binary, you should verify that Terraform is installed correctly by running `terraform -v` in your terminal. This command should return the Terraform version, indicating that the installation was successful.

Here's a step-by-step command-line guide to installing Terraform on Ubuntu:

```bash
# Step 1: Update your system (optional but recommended)
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

# Step 2: Install unzip if it's not already installed
sudo apt-get install unzip

# Step 3: Download Terraform (Replace the URL with the latest version)
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.1.0/terraform_1.1.0_linux_amd64.zip

# Step 4: Unzip the downloaded file
unzip terraform_1.1.0_linux_amd64.zip

# Step 5: Move the Terraform binary to /usr/local/bin
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/

# Step 6: Verify the installation
terraform -v
```

Please replace `https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.1.0/terraform_1.1.0_linux_amd64.zip` with the link to the latest version available from the Terraform website.

These instructions should help you install Terraform on an Ubuntu system. Note that commands and procedures might vary slightly depending on your Ubuntu version and your system configuration.
